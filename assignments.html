<h3>Assignment 0: Warmup <small>due 8:00am January 12</small></h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to serve as a simple warmup
exercise and to serve as a practice "dry run" for the submission
procedures of subsequent assignments. The general setup is as follows:
you will complete your assignments and check everything into a private
GitHub repo. Shortly after the assignment deadline, we'll pull your
repo for grading. Although we will be examining your solutions to
assignment 0, it will not be graded <i>per se</i>.</p>

<p>I'm assuming you already have
a <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> account. If not, create one
as soon as possible. Once you've signed up for an account, go and
<a href="https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new">request
an educational account</a>. This will allow you to create private
repos for free. Please do this as soon as possible since there may be
delays in the request verification process.</p>

<h4 style="padding-top: 10px">Setting up Hadoop and Spark</h4>

<p>Hadoop and Spark are already set up in
the <code>linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca</code>
environment. Alternatively, you may wish to install everything locally
on your own machine. See <a href="software.html">this page</a> for
more details.</p>

<p>Bespin is a library that contains reference implementations of "big
data" algorithms in MapReduce and Spark. We'll be using it throughout
this course. Go and run
the <a href="https://github.com/lintool/bespin">Word Count in
MapReduce and Spark</a> example as shown in the Bespin README (clone
and build the repo, download the data files, run word count in both
MapReduce in Spark, and verify output). Assuming you are
using <code>linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca</code> (or if you have
properly set up your local environment), this task should be as simple
as copying and pasting commands from the Bespin README.</p>

<h4 style="padding-top: 10px">Time to write some code!</h4>

<p>Create a <b>private</b> repo
called <code>bigdata2016w</code>. I'm assuming that you're
already familiar with Git and GitHub, but just in case, here
is <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo">how you
create a repo on GitHub</a>. For "Who has access to this repository?",
make sure you click "Only the people I specify". If you've
successfully gotten an educational account (per above), you should be
able to create private repos for free. If you're not already familiar
with Git, there are plenty of good tutorials online: do a simple web
search and find one you like.</p>

<p>What you're going to do now is to copy the MapReduce word count
example into you own private repo. Start with
<a href="assignments/pom.xml">this <code>pom.xml</code></a>: copy it
into your <code>bigdata2016w</code> repo. The replace this line in
that file:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;groupId&gt;ca.uwaterloo.cs.bigdata2016w.lintool&lt;/groupId&gt;
</pre>

<p>Instead of <code>lintool</code>, substitute your GitHub
username. You'll be working in your own namespace, so in everything
that follows, substitute your own GitHub username in place
of <code>lintool</code>.</p>

<p>Next, copy:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>bespin/src/main/java/io/bespin/java/mapreduce/wordcount/WordCount.java</code> over to
  <li><code>bigdata2016w/src/main/java/ca/uwaterloo/cs/bigdata2016w/lintool/assignment0/WordCount.java</code>.
</ul>

<p>Open up this new version of <code>WordCount.java</code> using a
text editor (or your IDE of choice) and change the Java package
to <code>ca.uwaterloo.cs.bigdata2016w.lintool.assignment0</code>.</p>

<p>Now, in the <code>bigdata2016w/</code> base directory, you should
be able to run Maven to build your package:</p>

<pre>
$ mvn clean package
</pre>

<p>Once the build succeeds, you should be able to run the word count
demo program in your own repository:</p>

<pre>
$ hadoop jar target/bigdata2016w-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
   ca.uwaterloo.cs.bigdata2016w.lintool.assignment0.WordCount \
   -input data/Shakespeare.txt -output wc
</pre>

<p>The output should be exactly the same as the same program in
Bespin, but the difference here is that the code is now in a
repository under your control, in your own private namespace.<p>

<p>Let's make a simple modification to word count: instead of counting
words, I want to count the occurrences of two-character prefixes of
words, i.e., the first two characters. That is, I want to know how
many words begin with "aa", "ab", "ac", etc., all the way to
"zz". Create a program called <code>PrefixCount</code> in the
package <code>ca.uwaterloo.cs.bigdata2016w.lintool.assignment0</code>. I
should be able to run your program as follows:</p>

<pre>
$ hadoop jar target/bigdata2016w-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
   ca.uwaterloo.cs.bigdata2016w.lintool.assignment0.PrefixCount \
   -input data/Shakespeare.txt -output cs489-2016w-lintool-a0-shakespeare
</pre>

<p>Answer the following questions:</p>

<p><b>Question 1.</b> In the Shakespeare collection, what are the
three most frequent two character prefixes and how many times does
each occur?</p>

<p><b>Question 2.</b> How frequent does the prefix "li" occur?</p>

<h4 style="padding-top: 10px">Turning in the Assignment</h4>

<p>At this point, you should have a GitHub
repo <code>bigdata2016w/</code> and inside the repo, you should have
the word count program copied over from Bespin and the new prefix count
implementation, along with your <code>pom.xml</code>.  Commit these
files. Next, create a file called <code>assignment1.md</code>
inside <code>bigdata2016w/</code>. In that file, put your answers to
the above questions. Use the Markdown annotation format: here's
a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">simple
guide</a>.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> there is no need to commit <code>data/</code>
or <code>target/</code> (or any results that you may have generated),
so your repo should be very compact &mdash; it should only have four
files: two Java source files, <code>pom.xml</code>,
and <code>assignment1.md</code>.</p>

<p>For this and all subsequent assignments, make sure everything is on
the master branch. Push your repo to GitHub. You can verify that it's
there by logging into your GitHub account in a web browser: your
assignment should be viewable in the web interface.</p>

<p>Almost there! Add the
user <a href="https://github.com/teachtool">teachtool</a> a
collaborator to your repo so that we can access it (under settings in
the main web interface on your repo). Note: do <b>not</b> add my
primary GitHub
account <a href="https://github.com/lintool">lintool</a> as a
collaborator.</p>

<p>And that's it!</p>

<p>Just to give you an idea of how we'll be grading future
assignments: we will clone your repo, build your code:</p>

<pre>
$ mvn clean package
</pre>

<p>And then run:</p>

<pre>
$ hadoop jar target/bigdata2016w-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
   ca.uwaterloo.cs.bigdata2016w.lintool.assignment0.PrefixCount \
   -input data/Shakespeare.txt -output cs489-2016w-lintool-a0-shakespeare
</pre>

<p>We'll make sure the data files are in the right place, and once the
code completes, we will verify the output. To make sure everything is
in the proper place, you should do a fresh clone, i.e., clone your own
repo, but in a different location, and run through these same
steps. If it works for you, it'll work for us.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, one main purpose of this assignment is to
provide a practice "dry run" of how assignments will be submitted in
the future. It is your responsibility to follow these instructions and
learn the process: we will work with you to get the process sorted out
for this assignment, but in subsequent assignments, you may be docked
points for failing to conform to our expectations.</p>
